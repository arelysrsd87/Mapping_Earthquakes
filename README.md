# Mapping_Earthquakes
# Overview of the Analysis
Build data visualizations with interactive features on earthqueakes from around the world. We will support desktop and mobile application development by using the latest eathquake GeoJSON data from the U.S. Geological Survey website. We will traverse and retrieve the earthquake data using JavaScript, D3 and leaflet libraries and plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request. On my map, the magnitude and location of the earthquake will be shown in a pop-up marker. The diameter of the marker should reflect the magnitude of he earthquake in their size and color.        
## Purpose of the Analysis
See earthquake data in relation to the tectonic plate's location on the earth. Additionally, we will add a third overlay that will allow us to see all the earthqueake's with a magnitude greater than 4.5 in the map. Last, we wil add a third map.
